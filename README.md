### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Lizzy Prosise! Currently, I work for Charter Spectrum as a Data & Reporting Analyst which I love! My interests include data analysis and visualization. For that reason, my focuses include Python, R, and SQL. I previously worked as an Oracle APEX developer so I have some SQL and PL/SQL experience specifically associated with Oracle DB. I plan to continue adding more code, the more I work through IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate. I also added my personal code for HackerRank solutions for both SQL and Python. If any of my code interests you, I hope you find it helpful! If you want to collaborate on any projects, I am open to any activities. You can contact me through my email: lizzypro72@gmail.com or my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizzy-prosise/. Please bear with me on my data science journey. ðŸ˜„
